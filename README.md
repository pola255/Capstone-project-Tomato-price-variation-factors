#Tomato price variation factors

##The objectives of this project are to analyse the price variation of tomato, its seasonality, and to develop a model
##to forecast the monthly tomato prices in the UK. To avoid autoregression, to compare and discover the relation with the
##tomato price, the historical weather data in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, where the tomatoes are produced, was used as well as
##price data for other commodities such as vegetables and oil.

##To get historical weather data of Bognor Regis a REST API from Dark Sky was used.

##The data is explored in the following parts:

######1) Exploratory data analysis using Time Series.
######2) Forecasting the Tomato price with Prophet.
######3) Completing the dataset with another feature(multivariable time series), forecasting the Tomato price with ensemble models using ######Random Forest algorithm.
######4) With the complete dataset forecasting the Tomato price with RNN using LSTM of Keras.
